    Set up a calibration board with a known pattern of ArUco markers. You can use the cv2.aruco.drawMarker function to generate the marker patterns and print them out on a sheet of paper.

    Take a series of images of the calibration board from different angles using a camera.

    Detect the ArUco markers in each image using the cv2.aruco.detectMarkers function. This function returns the corners and IDs of the detected markers.

    Use the corners of the detected markers to compute the pose (position and orientation) of the markers in the camera's coordinate system. You can use the cv2.aruco.estimatePoseSingleMarkers function for this purpose.

    For each marker, transform the pose from the camera's coordinate system to the world coordinate system using the extrinsic parameters of the camera (position and orientation of the camera relative to the world).

    Save the positions of the markers in the world coordinate system in a data structure (such as a list or a dictionary).

    Repeat steps 3-6 for all the images of the calibration board.

    Use the positions of the markers in the world coordinate system to create a map of the markers. You can use a 2D or 3D visualization library (such as Matplotlib or Matplotlib 3D) to plot the markers on a graph.
